# Vex-V5-Simulink-Expansion

## About The Project
This library incorporates the MATLAB-provided [VEX EDR V5 Robot Brain Support from Simulink](https://uk.mathworks.com/hardware-support/vex-edr-v5.html) into a higher level interface, alongside some addition functionality for the [VEX V5 Workcell](https://www.vexrobotics.com/v5/products/workcell) kit.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
This library allows for direct voltage control of the Vex V5 Smart Motors and so requires the [Advanced Smart Motor Blocks](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/435564-vex-v5-motor-voltage) files to be in the same directory. The files are provided in this repository for convenience.

### Installation
After downloading, ensure the `Vex-V5-Simulink-Expansion.slx`, `Advanced_SmartMotorRead.m` and `Advanced_SmartMotorWrite.m` are in the same working directory as the model the library is to be used in. Once this is completed, the library should appear in the Simulink Library Browser.
